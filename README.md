Moonshine-Pong
=========

A game of poing made with Lua and running in your browser using Moonshine (a JavaScript virtual machine).

[Test it out!](http://bigredwill.github.io/kanyepong/)
The above link is a port of Lua to the web, doesn't work as well as the desktop version but it's functional.
Credit to [www.loser.land/](Qwook) for the help with getting it online.
